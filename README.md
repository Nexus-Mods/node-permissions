# Permissions

This library allows file permissions to be set with higher level instructions than chmod.

The main purpose of this library is to allow windows ACLs to be set, while still doing something
sensible on other OSes.

# Support

* Windows - tested
* Linux/MacOS - untested, instructions are simply translated to chmod atm
